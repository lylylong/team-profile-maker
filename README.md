## Description

1. This Team Profile Maker is a very useful tool for team management. It's designed for team managers who need a quick access to team members' emails and GitHub profiles. The generated html page has a clean user interface and provides useful information.

2. The user/team manager will use a command-line to run this application. After download this repo, the user needs to install inquirer by running "npm install", and then the user is prompted for team manager questions, including the manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.

3. After entering the manager's info, the user is presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building the team profile:

- If the user selects the engineer option, a new section starts and the user is prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, after that the user will be back to the menu.
- If the user selects the intern option, another new section starts and the user is prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, after that the user will be back to the menu.
- The user can build info cards for all team members, there is no limitations. If the user decides to finish building the team profile, just selects the last option. The HTML is generated at the same time and it displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the user inputs.

4. When the user clicks on an email address in the HTML, the default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address. When the user clicks on the GitHub username, that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.
